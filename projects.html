                    <h4>Flight Dynamics Team - Aerodynamics and Stability Subteam </h4>
                        <p>As part of this subteam, I focus on ensuring that the club's rocket flies properly, making sure it's both statically and dynamically stable.</p>
                        <p>This is done by using RASAero II to model the rocket and size its 4 fins such that the rocket has a static margin of 1.3 wet, and 1.8 dry, and then running this model through our in-house MatLAB based trajectory simulator, which has 6 degrees of freedom and tells us whether the rocket will be stable or not in flight.</p>
                        <p>I personally worked on a mass vs. fin size analysis, where I determined how small shifts in the starting center of gravity would impact fin sizing as a whole, trying to see if we could use the same size fins for a small range of potential masses. This allowed us to inform the Structures team as to how accurately they needed to weigh the vehicle once the time came.</p>
                        <p>I also aided the Launch Structures team with designing an electrical equipment enclosure using SolidWorks.</p>
                        <p>So far, being on this team has given me knowledge on aerodynamic principles and on stability, and has given me experience in modeling and simulating complex events. As I spend more time with the team, I aim to learn even more about the intricacies of space flight, and to play a larger role in ensuring it can happen successfully.</p>

                <h2>HatefulAI</h2>
                <p>I and a partner codeveloped this basic personal assistant using the WebSpeechAPI for speech recognition and synthesis.</p>
                <p>We used the OpenWeatherMap API to provide weather data for the current location, and implemented basic math functions as well.
                    Location data was provided via implementing the GeoLocation API.
                </p>
                <p>This project mainly served as a way to learn JavaScript, and to get familiar with working with APIs, along with being a way to start parsing large datasets for what's relevant.</p>

                <h2>Yellow Jacket Flight Club</h2>
                <p>After starting my journey towards a private pilot license at home, I joind the club shortly after I learned about them.</p>
                <p>As a member, I'm responsible for ensuring the club's planes stay in good shape, and have the oppurtunity to learn about what maintenance entails.
                    As part of earning my private license, I also have learned the fundamentals regarding the aerodynamic properties of aircraft, and how to ensure safe and smooth flight as a pilot.

            <div class = "spotify">
                <h2>SpotifyRT</h2>
                <p>This is a simple Spotify web client, written with React. It simply displays the current song being played, and has play, pause, next track, and previous track.
                    The idea was to simply get familiar with both React and the Spotify API, and to not be too complicated as a first project. It ended up looking clean, and working exactly as intented,
                    providing a nice, responsive, and clean interface to display the current song being played.
                </p>
                <p>Note that this doesn't have the ability to start playing directly from the webapp, and requires something to be playing on the Spotify account to function.
                    Due to how the API is managed by Spotify, I cannot have anyone and everyone log in and have this app work unless I scale it up more to be a full fledged product. 
                    However, I can provide a burner login for anyone to use to test this webapp and check it out, provided they log into the webpage with this login and into a native Spotify client as well in order to start playback.
                    Play, pause, and track skipping through the API also requires Spotify premium on the account, which is not logical for me to pay for on a burner for a small project, so that functionality will not work with this burner.

                <p>This website itself is a personal project, constantly being updated with new experiences and details.
                    I kept this website simple, ensuring a streamlined development process and making sure my fundamental web development skills stayed sharp.
