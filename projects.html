                    <h4>Flight Dynamics Team - Aerodynamics and Stability Subteam </h4>
                        <p>As part of this subteam, I focus on ensuring that the club's rocket flies properly, making sure it's both statically and dynamically stable.</p>
                        <p>This is done by using RASAero II to model the rocket and size its 4 fins such that the rocket has a static margin of 1.3 wet, and 1.8 dry, and then running this model through our in-house MatLAB based trajectory simulator, which has 6 degrees of freedom and tells us whether the rocket will be stable or not in flight.</p>
                        <p>I personally worked on a mass vs. fin size analysis, where I determined how small shifts in the starting center of gravity would impact fin sizing as a whole, trying to see if we could use the same size fins for a small range of potential masses. This allowed us to inform the Structures team as to how accurately they needed to weigh the vehicle once the time came.</p>
                        <p>I also aided the Launch Structures team with designing an electrical equipment enclosure using SolidWorks.</p>
                        <p>So far, being on this team has given me knowledge on aerodynamic principles and on stability, and has given me experience in modeling and simulating complex events. As I spend more time with the team, I aim to learn even more about the intricacies of space flight, and to play a larger role in ensuring it can happen successfully.</p>

                <h2>HatefulAI</h2>
                <p>I and a partner codeveloped this basic personal assistant using the WebSpeechAPI for speech recognition and synthesis.</p>
                <p>We used the OpenWeatherMap API to provide weather data for the current location, and implemented basic math functions as well.
                    Location data was provided via implementing the GeoLocation API.
                </p>
                <p>This project mainly served as a way to learn JavaScript, and to get familiar with working with APIs, along with being a way to start parsing large datasets for what's relevant.</p>

                <h2>Yellow Jacket Flight Club</h2>
                <p>After starting my journey towards a private pilot license at home, I joind the club shortly after I learned about them.</p>
                <p>As a member, I'm responsible for ensuring the club's planes stay in good shape, and have the oppurtunity to learn about what maintenance entails.
                    As part of earning my private license, I also have learned the fundamentals regarding the aerodynamic properties of aircraft, and how to ensure safe and smooth flight as a pilot.

                <p>This website itself is a personal project, constantly being updated with new experiences and details.
                    I kept this website simple, ensuring a streamlined development process and making sure my fundamental web development skills stayed sharp.
