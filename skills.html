                <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
                <p>Proficient: Java, HTML/CSS</p>
                <p>Intermediate: Javascript, MatLAB</p>
                <p>Beginner: Python, C</p>
                <p>I've done a lot of work in Java for classes alone, while I learned the web development languages on my own for personal projects.
                    I've gotten my feet wet with Python and am decently familiar with the language, and will continue to get familiar with the language as I start taking classes that use it more heavily.
                    I'm getting more familiar with MatLAB as I work with the Yellow Jacket Space Program (YJSP), and have recently started learning C in class.

            <h2>Tools</h2>
            <p>Proficent: WSL, Git</p>
            <p>Intermediate: Bash, RASAero II, React, CircuitSim</p>
            <p>Beginner: SolidWorks</p>
            <p>I've gotten familiar with the Windows Subsystem for Linux from running it on my personal machine, and through that have become famililar with the terminal environment.
                I've had to use Git for school and personal reasons, and am comfortable there, and have been using CircuitSim for classes.
                I've gotten familiar with the basics of React.js, and have built a basic webpage with it using the Spotify API, bolstering my web dev skills.
                Recently, I've picked up both SolidWorks and RASAero II for work with YJSP, and am still getting more comfortable with both.
                I'm also comfortable using Windows, MacOS, and can work in different Linux/Unix environments, know my way around all basic office softwares such as Word and Excel as well.

            <h2>Relevant Classes</h2>
            <p>Taken: Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures/Algorithms, Intro to Mechanics</p>
            <p>Taking: Computer Organization/Programming, Intro to Electricity/Magnetism</p>
            <p>These classes represent the foundation of my learning, along with the multiple math classes such as Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus that I've taken.
                I'm on track to start taking classes more specialized to Modeling/Simulation and Intelligence soon.
