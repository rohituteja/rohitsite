                <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
                <p>Proficient: Java, HTML/CSS</p>
                <p>Intermediate: Javascript, MatLAB, Python, C</p>
                <p>Beginner: - </p>
                <p> As I've been progressing in school, I've become adept at using Java, Python, and C,
                    with Java still being the language I have the most background in. My MatLAB skills are improving as I use it more in my 
                    work with the Yellow Jacket Space Program, and my web development skills have developed along side my personal projects.

            <h2>Tools</h2>
            <p>Proficent: WSL, Git, Microsoft Office</p>
            <p>Intermediate: Bash, Docker, RASAero II, React.js, CircuitSim</p>
            <p>Beginner: Tableau</p>
            <p> Many of these are skills I've naturally picked up, whether from using them for school or for personal reasons,
                or even just out of curiosity. I'm comfortable with all of tools listed here, even if I may be just a beginner still learning all of the ins and outs.
                I'd like to think I pick things up fast as well, being able to get the basics of a new tool quickly.

            <h2>Relevant Classes</h2>
            <p>Taken: Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures/Algorithms, Computer Organization/Programming</p>
            <p>Taking: Intro to Artificial Intelligence, Systems and Networks, Design and Analysis of Algorithms </p>
            <p>These classes represent the foundation of my learning, along with the multiple math classes such as Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus that I've taken.
                I've started taking more specialized classes for Intelligence, and will soon take some for Modeling/Simulation as well.
